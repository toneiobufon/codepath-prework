If you recorded multiple GIFs for all the implemented features, you can add them here:

This is the basic version of the game, it would have been great to add more features, but just found out today about this opportunity.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
No outside sources used, but I am already thinking of effects or images that can be included. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The hidden/toggle aspect whas not working properly, the logic was good, but there was a typo. To solve this, debugging and reviewing every line was necessary to find the error. Console was a good tool to see what was not working. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
This pre-work was a great way learn or practice our skills. Will the 10 week curriculum include projects already selected or will participants have the choice to pick what they want to work on. Along the same lines, will participants work individually or in groups? Will hackathons be part of the 10 weeks?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Most likely work on creating random patterns, changing colors and sounds, adding pictures. Giving limited time to respond. Perhaps create a 2nd level or levels.
